# Deployment Guide

## Requirements
Before you deploy, you must have the following in place:
*  [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/) 
*  [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) 
*  [Node 10 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Step 1: Setting Up a Demo Amazon HealthLake Database
In this step we will set up an Amazon HealthLake Database instance with autogenerated Synthea mock patients.

1. In the AWS Console, navigate to the HealthLake service page.
2. Click on the **Create/View Data Stores** button, then click **Create Data Store** on the next page.
3. Create a name, then make sure to select the follwing option: "Preload sample data in FHIR R4 format". Keep the other default options. Then click **Create Data Store**.
4. On the next page, click on the name of the database you just created and make note of the Endpoint URL.


## Step 2: Front-end Deployment
In this step we will use the Amplify console to deploy and build the front-end application automatically.

## Step 3: Providing Cognito Permissions to Access Amazon HealthLake
In this step, we need to provide our Cognito Authentication service with permissions to access Amazon HealthLake.

1. In the AWS Console, navigate to the IAM page. Then click on **Roles** from the left-hand menu.
2. Locate the "authRole" associated with the frontend application from the list and click on it. It should be named similar to the following: amplify-smartonfhir-dev-<some number>-authRole.
3. Click on the **Attach policies** button.
4. Search for *AmazonHealthLakeFullAccess*, select it, then click **Attach policy**.
